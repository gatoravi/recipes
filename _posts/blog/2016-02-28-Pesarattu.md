##Pesarattu

- Soak moong dal in water overnight.

- Blend in a blender(mixie) the next morning with
a little bit of salt, a piece of ginger and 4 red chillies.

- Cook like a dosa on a skillet.

- Add a little bit of grated onion and coriander(cilantro) on the inside.

- Serve with ketchup/chutney on the side.

Note - This is a healthy breakfast, mostly just lentils.
